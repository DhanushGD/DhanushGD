### 🌟 About Me
AI Engineer specialized in **LLM fine-tuning**, **agentic AI systems**, **RAG pipelines** and **enterprise GenAI architecture**.

At **Automation Anywhere**, I build production-grade AI solutions—ranging from **RAG pipelines** and **multi-agent orchestration** to advanced **tool/agent interoperability** and **in-house model fine-tuning**.  
My work includes **custom LLM fine-tuning**, **MCP-driven integrations**, and **A2A-enabled intelligent workflows** that enable agents to reason, retrieve information, and take safe, autonomous actions.  
I focus on designing **scalable, high-impact GenAI systems** that elevate enterprise automation through reliable, context-aware, and orchestrated agent behavior.
